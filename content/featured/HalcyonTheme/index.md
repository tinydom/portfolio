Goobr was envisioned as an app for pets to make new friends. Pet owners would be able to leverage their pet profiles to engage other owners with the same type of pet. As envisioned by the client, I was part of starting XII team to build out the MVP for Goobr with its core features. These include your petâ€™s profile and messaging system that allow engagement with other pet owners. This is of significant advantage to pet owners who wish to interact and share experiences and recommendations with regard to their pets.
